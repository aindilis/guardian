Method sharing raises additional issues, some of that we discussed.
Situations are described by
the concrete task that a system-builder wishes his knowledge system to solve.
As we saw, there
will often be gaps between the way a system-builder conceived the task and the way methods
would be indexed in a library.
Such a gap can probably never be completely eliminated.
However, some of the current ideas in the field that we discussed − assumptions that are attached
to the methods and adaptors that use these assumptions − can help to span this conceptual gap.

note-2
The term ``task'' has been used in two related, but still distinct, ways, causing some
confusion.
In one usage, task is a set or sequence of things to do: that is, task is something
you do.
Another usage has task as a term for a goal type, leaving open what the steps are in
achieving it.
We use it in the latter sense; that is, tasks are goal types, what needs to be
accomplished.
note-3
Our examples throughout are chosen mainly for clarity in making the conceptual points
rather than for accuracy or completeness in describing the knowledge.
In particular, in this
example, the knowledge for establishing hypotheses is usually substantially more complex
than the example.

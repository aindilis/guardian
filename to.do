(Guard, guard, guard, guard, guard, ...)

(process books on time management using KNext to extract an
 ontology of time management)

(download sample time management ontologies)

(we need an ontology builder that works like a focused crawler
 but uses knext to build the ontology, calculates semantic
 distance from the central concepts)

(work on the prolog access to the KNext output
 (that seems like a difficult problem worth doing later when we're
  not so tired.))

(integrate XWN)

(completed (integrate guardian into the command REPL loop as well with $ps1))
(solution (integrate guardian with system for analyzing commands the user
 types) (execution-engine))
(solution (have system for predicting future commands on the basis of
 previous commands) (use same stuff as predict-the-words-in-the-next-sentence))
(Guardian should analyze the commands that are typed in using
 that technique we did the other day.  should also run after
 every command.)

(Check sounds settings on phone every day.)

(Come up with a finer grained nuance for things like urgent.
 Climate change is urgent but not in the same way as going to the
 bathroom is, figure out what maybe cyc uses for this.)
